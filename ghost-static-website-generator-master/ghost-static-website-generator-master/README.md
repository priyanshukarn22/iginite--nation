# Ghost Static Website Generator

Generate static HTML files for custom ghost hosting and publish them on AWS S3 as static website.
To host the static blog site under a path `/blog` (`https://yourdomain.com/blog`), the ghost needs to be hosted with the same path like `https://content.yourdomain.com/blog`.

If your blog is hosted under `https://content.yourdomain.com` and you want to host the static website under `https://yourdomain.com/blog`, this is not possible. Same applies for the other way around.

You can also replace certain text from the generated static files by passing the following arguments `custom_replace_keys` and `custom_replace_values`. For more details, refer Inputs and Example usage section. It doesn't support the multiline replacement as of now.

Additionally, it also provides the functionality to upload the static HTML files to S3 bucket. To access these files publicly, make it as a public bucket and enable static website hosting.
